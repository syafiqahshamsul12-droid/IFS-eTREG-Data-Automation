# IFS-eTREG-Data-Automation
This project is developed with an internal macro-based automation tool to streamline data management, follow-up actions, and email preparation within the IFS eTREG workflow system using Excel VBA.  

Key impact: Reduced manual checking time by **60%**, improved follow-up efficiency, and ensured structured execution for future automation.

## 💡 Why This Project?  
During my internship, I realized:  
- Manual checking was time-consuming across multiple files  
- Follow-ups were delayed due to human error  
- Teams lacked a guided structure for routine actions  

This tool provided a **QNA-style guide** with buttons and prompts for faster, more accurate execution.
